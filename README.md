## Introduction

Biomass traits are critical for understanding plant growth and productivity. This analysis investigates various traits, including leaf number, root length, stem length, and dry weights, to assess their impact on biomass production. The results will help in identifying key traits that can be targeted for improvement in breeding programs.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following variables:

- **Rep**: Replication number
- **Geno**: Genotype of the plant
- **LN**: Leaf Number
- **RL**: Root Length
- **SL**: Stem Length
- **LA**: Leaf Area
- **SDW**: Shoot Dry Weight
- **RDW**: Root Dry Weight
- **LDW**: Leaf Dry Weight
- **TDW**: Total Dry Weight

The dataset contains **96 rows** representing different observations across **24 genotypes**.

## Methodology

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of traits and their relationships.
3. **Clustering**: Performing hierarchical clustering to group genotypes based on their traits.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Conducting ANOVA to assess the significance of differences between genotypes.

## Analysis

The analysis is conducted using R, with the following key packages:

- library(agricolae)
- library(dendextend)
- library(dplyr)
- library(ggplot2)
- library(pheatmap)
- library(metan)
- library(stats)
- library(MASS)
- library(factoextra)
- library(gridExtra)
- library(gt)
- library(psych)
- library(ggdendro)
- library(tidyverse)
## Results

The results of the analysis will be presented in the form of visualizations and statistical summaries. Key findings will include:

- Clustering of genotypes based on biomass traits.
- Significant differences in traits among different genotypes.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the relationships between biomass traits and their implications for plant breeding. The findings can guide future research and breeding strategies aimed at improving biomass production.
